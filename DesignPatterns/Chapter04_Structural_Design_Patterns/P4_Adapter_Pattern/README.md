# Structural Design Pattern 4: Adapter Pattern

## Motivation

Adapter Pattern deals with the problems of **incompatible classes and interfaces** or **legacy code** or frequently changing **APIs**. So we need to use Adapter Pattern to make compatible between legacy code and features.


## Definition

Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate and work together. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.


## Examples

Example 1: Vehicle call `accelerate` method

Example 2: Parser parse CSV and XML files

Example 3: Built-in static method `Arrays.asList`


## Pros and Cons
