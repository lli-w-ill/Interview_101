# (L) Liskov Substitution Principle

## Motivation

Objects of subclasses behave in the same way as the objects of its superclass.


## Definition

Object of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses **without breaking the application**.


## Supplementary

We can use **abstract classes or interfaces or combine abstract classes and an interface** to make Liskov Substitution principle be valid.

The violation of Liskov principle is a latent violation of Open-closed principle.
