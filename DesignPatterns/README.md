# SOLID Principle & Design Patterns

**Design Principle** 可以类比 Abstract Data Types (defines the behaviors without the implementation). 

**Design Patterns** 可以类比 Data Structures (concrete implementation)

Design Principles (such as SOLID principles) are specifications. They allow scalable, maintanable and reusable software architecture.

Design Patterns are concrete implementatio of design principles and are about how to design the code.


# 3 Main Design Patterns

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational Patterns are designed for **class instantiation** (class creational patterns and object creational patterns).

## 2. Structural patterns

Structural Patterns are designed for class structure (how to increase the functionality of a class).

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral Patterns are dealing with how to communicate effectiely between given classes. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out the communication.
